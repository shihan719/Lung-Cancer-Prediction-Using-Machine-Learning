# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

***Overview***

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of lung cancer based on various health-related parameters. The model employs both RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier algorithms to enhance accuracy.

***Contents***

***Data Preprocessing:***
Categorical variables were one-hot encoded to prepare the dataset for training.

***Model Training:***
Five models were trained - RandomForest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine - using a dataset containing features related to lung health.

***Model Evaluation:***
The accuracy of both models was evaluated on a test dataset to assess their predictive performance.

***Graphical User Interface (GUI):***
A Tkinter-based GUI was developed to provide users with an intuitive platform for inputting personal health information and receiving instant predictions regarding the likelihood of lung cancer.

***How to Use:***
Run the provided Python script.
Input health-related information via the GUI.
Click the "Predict" button to obtain predictions for the presence of lung cancer.

***Dependencies:***
Ensure that the required Python libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, Tkinter) are installed.

***File Descriptions:***
lung_cancer_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for model training and evaluation.
lung_cancer_gui.py: Python script for the GUI implementation.

***Conclusion:***
The successful execution of this project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in predicting lung cancer. The user-friendly interface enhances accessibility for early detection and intervention.
